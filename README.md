(viii)install;click the 'install" button to start the installation process
(x) Launch Visual Studio once the installation is complete
(xi)sign in with your microsoft account or create one if prompted
(xii)you're now ready to start coding, create a new project.


3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

*Setting up Git requires the following steps
-Download the executable Git file from git-scm.com/downloads.
-run the installation file with adminstrator rights
-choose an appropriate installation location such as C:\_tools\git.
-Install the default components, including Git GUI here and Git Bash here.

-Chose the extra option to enable system caching.
* test the windows git install
the basic commands such as init,add,config,status and commit

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

Python programming language can be used to build websites and software,automate tasks and conduct data analysis
-for one to use python,he/she needs to download it from the internet and install in his/her computer by considering the following steps
-I'll install Python 3.8.6 version on my windows 10

1. *Select the Python's verion to download
2. *Click on the Install now double click the executable file, which is downloaded; the window will open then select customize installation and proceed
click on the Add path check box,it will set the python path automatically. also you can click on the customize installation to choose desired location and features.other important thing is install launcher for the all user must be checked

3. *Installation in process
then try to run python on the command prompt.type the command python-version in case of python 3

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

MySQL is a well-established relational database management system. acess your windows server and download MySQL installer. you're always given the option to download either the web community verion or full MySQL package

*Steps to download and install MySQL Database

By selecting this option, the download process starts immediately. once the download is complete,you can execute the MySQL installer file from the download folder
it can take a few moments while windows configures the MySQL installer and prepares the installation and configuration process.

3. *Set up MySQL installer for windows
after accepting the oracle licence agreement terms, the first screen you encounter allows you to define which MySQL products are going to be installed. you can choose between several predefined options or create your custom set up
-Developer default;installs all the tools you need to develop and micromanage your MySQL databases effectivly.
-Server Only; is used to install an instance of the MySQL server and forgo other MySQL products
-Client Only;installs all products except the MySQL server and associated tools
-The full configuration installs all available MySQL products

4. *Configure MySQL server on windows

9. Complete MySQL installation on Windows Server
you are given option to copy the installation process log to the windows clipboard





7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub  repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.
